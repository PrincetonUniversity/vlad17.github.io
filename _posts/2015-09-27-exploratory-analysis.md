# Week 1: Exploratory analysis

Our goal is to explain stock market behavior by relying on non-macroeconomic news sources. Using macroeconomic data is an obvious (and previously successful) approach, but using the highly diverse and worldwide event data from our dataset may reveal more interesting explanations for stock market behavior.

## Precise questions we will explore

## The Data


#### GDELT 

This is a database of worldwide data. It contains a rich graph with parsed information, as well as a database with more rudimentary information. [Raw data link on GDELT site](data.gdeltproject.org/events/index.html).

 
Format

#### Stock Market Information


## Exploratory Analysis

We retrieved stock pricing information from Yahoo Finance for S&P 500 (^GSPC) from January 1, 2005 to December 31, 2005. This data included the S&P's opening, high, low, closing, and adjusted closing price for each date in this range. We also looked at GDELT data for 2005. 

#### Initial GDELT analysis

#### Initial stock analysis

#### Initial cross-dataset exploration

#### Previous Work
Previous work as looked at forecasting various financial data with a broad array of techniques from traditional machine learning approaches to finding new feature sets from Wikipedia, Google, and the news.

- Analyzing the effect of news on stock prices: ''Fundamental macroeconomic news has little effect on stock prices... Effect of news... depends on the varying responses of expected flows relative to equity discount rates''

- Using Internet search data to predict pricing data: ''the team found a strong correlation between Internet searches for a company?s name and its trade volume, the total number of times the stock changed hands over a given week... But the Google data couldn't predict its price''
