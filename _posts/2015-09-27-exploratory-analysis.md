# Week 1: Exploratory analysis

Our goal is to explain stock market behavior by relying on non-macroeconomic news sources. Using macroeconomic data is an obvious (and previously successful) approach, but using the highly diverse and worldwide event data from our dataset may reveal more interesting explanations for stock market behavior.

## Precise questions we will explore

## The Data

#### GDELT 

This is a database of worldwide data. It contains a rich graph with parsed information, as well as a database with more rudimentary information. [Raw data link on GDELT site](data.gdeltproject.org/events/index.html).
